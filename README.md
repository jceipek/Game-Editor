Note: This project is on hold while we determine whether developing our game in Unity will be faster. Hopefully we will be able to make this engine based on what we learn from using Unity.

What?
=====

A planned C++ game engine/editor with Python for Game Logic. Inspired by the editing flexibility of Aquaria's game editor and Blender's keyboard shortcuts.

Why?
====

The Monocle Engine isn't done and is more complicated than what I want; I haven't been able to compile the Angel Engine, and a lot of the other solutions are slow, don't support Python, are closed-source, or aren't cross-platform.

Also, writing game engines is a fun learning experience, and I want to do something cool for my Game Design class.

Dependencies?
=============

Right now? Just SFML (2.0).
I'm developing on OS X 10.7 for now, but I will begin testing on other platforms as soon as I bring other people on board.
